# website-project
In this project I built a one-page scrollable website with sidebar navigation to learn how to create static websites using HTML and CSS. To learn and experiment, I used a wide variety of HTML tags and CSS selectors, and incorporated many CSS properties. To fully concentrate on building the website I have used dummy content, i.e. a lorem ipsum filler.
